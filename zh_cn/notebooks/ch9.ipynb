    "After reading this chapter, you will be able to:\n",
    "- Define, implement, and apply the Exponential and Report Noisy Max mechanisms\n",
    "- Describe the challenges of applying the Exponential mechanism in practice\n",
    "- Describe the advantages of these mechanisms\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental mechanisms we have seen so far (Laplace and Gaussian) are focused on numerical answers, and add noise directly to the answer itself. What if we want to return a precise answer (i.e. no added noise), but still preserve differential privacy? One solution is the exponential mechanism {cite}`mcsherry2007`, which allows selecting the \"best\" element from a set while preserving differential privacy. The analyst defines which element is the \"best\" by specifying a *scoring function* that outputs a score for each element in the set, and also defines the set of things to pick from. The mechanism provides differential privacy by *approximately* maximizing the score of the element it returns - in other words, to satisfy differential privacy, the exponential mechanism sometimes returns an element from the set which does *not* have the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential mechanism satisfies $\\epsilon$-differential privacy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The analyst selects a set $\\mathcal{R}$ of possible outputs\n",
    "2. The analyst specifies a scoring function $u : \\mathcal{D} \\times \\mathcal{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ with global sensitivity $\\Delta u$\n",
    "3. The exponential mechanism outputs $r \\in \\mathcal{R}$ with probability proportional to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\exp \\Big(\\frac{\\epsilon u(x, r)}{2 \\Delta u} \\Big)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest practical difference between the exponential mechanism and the previous mechanisms we've seen (e.g. the Laplace mechanism) is that the output of the exponential mechanism is *always* a member of the set $\\mathcal{R}$. This is extremely useful when selecting an item from a finite set, when a noisy answer would not make sense. For example, we might want to pick a date for a big meeting, which uses each participant's personal calendar to maximize the number of participants without a conflict, while providing differential privacy for the calendars. Adding noise to a date doesn't make much sense: it might turn a Friday into a Saturday, and *increase* the number of conflicts significantly. The exponential mechanism is perfect for problems like this one: it selects a date *without noise*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponential mechanism is interesting for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The privacy cost of the mechanism is just $\\epsilon$, regardless of the size of $\\mathcal{R}$ - more on this next.\n",
    "- It works for both finite and infinite sets $\\mathcal{R}$, but it can be really challenging to build a practical implementation which samples from the appropriate probability distribution when $\\mathcal{R}$ is infinite.\n",
    "- It represents a \"fundamental mechanism\" of $\\epsilon$-differential privacy: all other $\\epsilon$-differentially private mechanisms can be defined in terms of the exponential mechanism with the appropriate definition of the scoring function $u$."

    "Can we recover the exponential mechanism using the Laplace mechanism? In the case of a finite set $\\mathcal{R}$, the basic idea of the exponential mechanism - to select from a set with differential privacy - suggests a naive implementation in terms of the Laplace mechanism:\n",
